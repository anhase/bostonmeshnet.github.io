## Who Are We

BostonMesh is a community owned and operated mesh network consisting of many nodes spread throughout the city. Nodes connect securely (aka "mesh") with open technologies like [cjdns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cjdns)

## Our Mission

We aim to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies—be it power outages or internet disruption—running software that helps our community with hyperlocal maps and events.
